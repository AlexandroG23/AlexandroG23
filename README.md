I'm Junior developer and love learning new things and creating projects that people can enjoy, that's why I started my career developing websites, desktop applications and managing databases.

In addition, for years I have been acquiring knowledge with projects carried out at the university and on my own.

- ðŸ”­ I'm looking for work as a frontend and backend developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript, React.js, Oracle, Node Js and Express.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL...
- âš¡ More about me: Like many I love to play video games, and I also like cats. In my spare time I play the guitar and inform myself about things related to technology.
